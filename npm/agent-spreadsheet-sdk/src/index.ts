/**
 * `agent-spreadsheet-sdk` - one object model over two canonical runtimes.
 *
 * - {@link createLocalSpreadsheet} runs the operations in-process over the
 *   `agent-spreadsheet-wasm` bindings and owns workbook sessions.
 * - {@link connectSpreadsheetServer} drives an `agent-spreadsheet-mcp` process over the
 *   canonical `/v1` HTTP route and shares its workspace, forks, and checkpoints.
 *
 * The MCP client adapter was dropped in 0.15; MCP hosts use an MCP client. The 0.14
 * backends remain under `agent-spreadsheet-sdk/compat` for one release.
