# Surface Capability Matrix (CLI / MCP / WASM / SDK)

Status: active migration baseline (Wave 4 canonical MCP adapter)
Owner: Tranche 35 (tickets/35-js-surface-migration)

This matrix is the planning baseline for cross-surface migration.

## Legend

- **Classification**
  - `ALL` = intended shared capability (CLI + MCP + WASM via shared core)
  - `CLI_ONLY` = host/operator concern (no MCP/WASM parity required)
  - `MCP_ONLY` = agent/session orchestration concern
  - `SHARED_PARTIAL` = shared semantics, but currently only implemented on subset
- **WASM target**
  - `mvp` = planned for initial WASM surface
  - `later` = planned after MVP
  - `n/a` = intentionally not a WASM concern

Boundary contract: `docs/architecture/surface-boundary-rules.md`

## C) Canonical registry migration status

Wave 3A registers the canonical discovery/read/search/analysis surface. Wave 3B adds `write`, Wave 3C adds lifecycle/history/proof, and Wave 3D adds capability-gated rendering, SheetPort, and VBA operations. Wave 4 makes the descriptor-derived canonical router the default MCP surface; `SPREADSHEET_MCP_SLIM_SURFACE=false` adds the legacy 0.13 compatibility names and preserves legacy behavior for shared names. `asp operations`, `asp schema <operation>`, `asp op <operation>`, and MCP derive lookup and schemas from the registry.

| Canonical operation | Existing compatibility projection | Dispatcher implementation | Capability | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `list_workbooks` | CLI/MCP `list_workbooks` remains legacy data-only | canonical discovery adapter; no request/resource binding | `workbook_discovery` | low |
| `describe_workbook` | legacy metadata and workbook-summary tools remain separate | exact metadata plus opt-in scoped derived summary | `workbook_read` | low |
| `list_sheets`, `sheet_overview`, `read_table` | CLI/MCP wrappers project canonical `data` | shared semantic implementations | `workbook_read` | low |
| `read_cells` | legacy `range_values` and `sheet_page` remain available | correlated range/row engine with revision/request-bound opaque cursor | `workbook_read` | low |
| `inspect_cells` | legacy detail view stays separate to retain its historical partial-payload behavior; canonical fails before truncation | shared semantic implementation with distinct truncation policy | `workbook_read` | low |
| `named_ranges` | legacy MCP wrapper projects canonical `data` | shared semantic implementation | `workbook_read` | low |
| `read_layout` | legacy `layout_page` stays separate | explicitly lossy layout projection | `workbook_read` | low |
| `export_grid` | legacy `grid_export` stays separate | coordinate-preserving paged grid export of cell content and explicit formatting; implicit presentation defaults excluded | `workbook_read` | low |
| `analyze_styles` | legacy sheet/workbook style tools stay separate | closed `scope.kind` union with bounded-count coverage | `workbook_read` | low |
| `search_values` | legacy `find_value` projects canonical `data` | preserves label, direction, scope, type, header, and context options | `workbook_read` | low |
| `search_formulas` | legacy formula search/volatile tools stay separate | closed `result_mode` branches and actual function classifications | `workbook_read` | low |
| `formula_trace` | legacy structured-cursor wrapper stays separate; canonical uses a revision/request-bound opaque cursor | shared formula analysis |
| `formula_map` | legacy MCP wrapper projects canonical `data` | shared formula analysis with opaque canonical continuation | `workbook_read` | low |
| `profile_table`, `sheet_statistics` | legacy MCP wrappers project canonical `data` | shared bounded analysis | `workbook_read` | low |
| `write` | `edit_batch`, `mutate_batch`, and family tools remain compatibility surfaces | one ordered dispatcher over the existing family implementations; pure preview, CAS, atomic apply, explicit partial apply, and one-bundle stage | `workbook_write` | destructive ceiling; request-aware moderate/high/destructive |
| `create_fork`, `list_forks`, `discard_fork` | legacy fork tools remain unchanged | typed resource discovery/lifecycle with no path-bearing canonical responses; create/discard use revision validation | `workbook_write` | moderate/low/destructive |
| `recalculate`, `verify_workbook` | legacy proof tools remain unchanged | canonical recalc uses copy-evaluate-CAS-swap; verification preserves the F1 state, coverage, and proof contract for both resources | `workbook_write` | high/low |
| `export_fork` | legacy `save_fork` retains path-oriented MCP adapter UX | workspace destination plus portable artifact metadata; canonical data never relies on a server-local path | `workbook_write` | high |
| `get_changes` | legacy `get_edits`/`get_changeset` remain unchanged | honest `view.kind` union: stored canonical operation audit or direct fork-base net diff | `workbook_write` | low |
| `checkpoint` | four legacy checkpoint tools remain unchanged | action union with CAS mutations; atomic restore reports removed operations/stages and retained/invalidated checkpoints | `workbook_write` | destructive ceiling; request-aware low/moderate/high/destructive |
| `staged_change` | three legacy staging tools remain unchanged | action union; canonical bundles bind applicability to base content revision, replay through the write dispatcher, and are consumed only after success | `workbook_write` | destructive ceiling; request-aware low/moderate/destructive |
| `screenshot_sheet` | legacy MCP screenshot tool remains unchanged | validates bounded names/ranges before rendering, selects `native` or `libreoffice` with an optional `png_level`, and returns a content-addressed PNG handle plus renderer identity, fidelity, warnings, geometry, and calculation state without server paths; every adapter hands the bytes across its own boundary | `screenshot_rendering` | low |
| `sheetport_manifest` | legacy CLI hierarchy and `get_manifest_stub` remain unchanged | closed action union; schema/validate/normalize are unbound portable content actions, while candidates/bind_check require a resource | `sheetport` | low |
| `execute_sheetport` | legacy `sheetport run` and `execute_manifest` remain unchanged | bounded typed values with declared/returned coverage, typed status/error codes, and structured missing-input/constraint failures | `sheetport` | low |
| `inspect_vba` | legacy VBA summary/source tools remain unchanged | closed bounded views with opaque cursors bound to resource, request fingerprint, and workbook revision; stream names, debug bodies, and paths are omitted | `vba` | low |

Canonical responses use the versioned operation envelope and state reads carry `revision_id`. Value-bearing reads expose calculation state. Merged responses echo branch discriminants. Checked-in full JSON fixtures cover every branch, action, and view, including deterministic screenshot artifact tokens.

Compatibility projections are only routed through the dispatcher when the legacy response can be reconstructed without loss. `range_values`/`sheet_page`, workbook summaries, layout/grid, style summaries, and formula-search variants remain separate compatibility implementations rather than claiming false response parity. Existing write and lifecycle tools retain their response/error projections while sharing the canonical state and family implementations where response compatibility permits. Canonical export keeps path-oriented CLI/MCP/WASM concerns in adapters. Wave 4 authorizes the canonical MCP default while preserving the 0.13 router only in explicit compatibility mode.
